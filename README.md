# Belgic

A webserver for [ambiorix](https://ambiorix.john-coene.com) applications.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/devOpifex/belgic
```

or

``` bash
go install github.com/devOpifex/belgic@latest
```

or download one of the available binaries.

## Use

Belgic requires a very simple configuration file.

```json
{
 "applications": "/belgic/apps",
 "port": "8080"
}
```

To create it you can use the `config` command and pass it the _full
path_ to the _directory_ where you want the configuration file
to be created.

```bash
./belgic config -p "path/to/directory"
```

- `applications`: the directory containing the ambiorix applications
you want to serve.
- `port`: port on which the apps should be served.

Add the `BELGIC_CONFIG` environment variable to point to the configuration
file you just created.

Voil√†, all set, just launch the server.

```bash
./belgic
```

## How it works

It's very similar to the way shiny-server works.
Point Belgic to a directory containing the applications you want
to serve (in the config file).

belgic then looks at all these apps and serves them individually.
e.g.:

```
/apps
  | /app1
  |   app.R
  | /app2
      app.R
```

In the above, point the config file to `/apps`, run belgic,
then the applications will be served at `mysite.com/app1`
and `mysite.com/app2`.

## Customise

You can change the homepage (at `/`) that displays all the applications
served as well as the 404 page.

To do so, at the root of the directory containing your applications
(path specified in the config file), place:

- `index.html`: to change the homepage.
- `404.html`: to change the 404 page.

These are rendered using Go's standard template module which is also
used by Hugo, so if you have used blogdown in the past this should 
look familiar. Best place to start is probably the very simple source
code of the default 
[index.html](https://github.com/devOpifex/belgic/blob/master/internal/app/ui/index.html).
